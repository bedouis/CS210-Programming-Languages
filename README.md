# Cplusplus-Program
The program presents the user with a menu of options. The first option reads the contents of a file and prints a list of items and their frequency in the input file. 
The second option reads an input from the user and prints the frequency of the item in the file.
The third option prints down a histogram of the items and their frequency. The items are initially read from the input file and then written to a new file with each item and their frequency on a line.
The fourth and last option permits the user to exit the program.
